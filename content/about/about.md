Hailing from the open spaces of West Texas, Bushong started to love music at a very early age. With his parents being educators and gospel singers, he was able to harness an early ear for pleasing melodies and harmonies that would later translate to guitar and piano. After a short engineering phase at Texas Tech University - Bushong found himself writing, arranging and producing his first full album, ***Aurum***, at age 19, in Lubbock, Texas with acclaimed engineer and studio mogul, Scott Farris. 

After a brief stint in the Lubbock music scene, Bushong headed for the sounds of Austin and continued to climb to the top of the music spectrum. Founding and performing with the eclectic band **Bravo/Zulu** and dabbling in one-man acoustic presentations, Bushong was ready to head west to the lights of L.A.

Gathering a world of knowledge in the city of Angles, Bushong made his way back to Texas as a seasoned songwriter, producer, arranger and performer. Now, with his band, **Brock Bushong and the Still Shakes**, Bushong has become one of the area's leading performers and top billed sensations. 

An amazing collaboration with percussionist, bassist and songwriter, Vince Mejia, an Indiana native and veteran player with Joe King Carrasco and the Crowns, Burt Wills and Rocky Hill, has allowed a new sound to emerge and gain exceptional recognition in the region. Bushong and the new ensemble continue to record and produce some of the most original compositions that Texas and the country has the privilege of experiencing. It seems fitting that Bushong’s ability to create tones that express the true meaning of integrity permeates every fiber of his audience’s being. With this in mind, musicians from all styles and concepts can certainly understand how this rising star has become a top sensation and solidified his stamp on the music business as none other than the “Player’s Player.”
